A library for creating overlays in Linux, used with glium and winit. Check lib.rs for an example on how to use it.

Tested only on KDE Plasma.

Proper documentation will probably be added later as development goes on.

Currently, it can draw basic shapes (rectangles, circles, lines, triangles) and text. Textures will maybe be added later and multiple fonts are currently unsupported.

The code is basically unreadable and there are many improvements that could be made here.
